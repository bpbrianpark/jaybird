"""
Neural network model architecture for image classification.

This file defines the model architecture using transfer learning:
- Base model selection (ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.)
- Custom classification head for multi-label classification
- Model initialization with pre-trained weights
- Forward pass implementation
- Configurable number of output classes/tags
